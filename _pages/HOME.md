Welcome to the Healthcare Operations Management Excellence (HOME) lab, a hub of academic excellence and practical solutions in healthcare operations management. We utilize advanced analytics, such as operations research, big data, machine learning, and simulation, to enhance healthcare operations. Our efforts span various settings, including emergency response, surgical process optimization, and outpatient service efficiency. Dedicated to resolving operational issues within healthcare systems, we aim to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Collaborating with industry experts and organizations, we convert research into impactful strategies, improving care delivery and operational outcomes.

## Projects

#### 3\. _Advanced Intelligent Scheduling in Bio-manufacturing. Collaborated with **Ningbo Health Gene Technologies Co. Ltd**._

This project aims to develop a production planning solution through data analysis and optimization modeling techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of production planning for the testing reagent products.

#### 2\. _Emergency Medical Service location and dispatching. Collaborated with **Ningbo Emergency Center**._

The objective of this project is to enhance the delivery of emergency medical services (EMS) by optimizing resource allocation and dispatching strategies for ambulances and paramedics. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we aim to develop predictive models capable of accurately forecasting high-demand areas for emergency services. These forecasts will enable proactive positioning of EMS resources to ensure rapid response times. To translate these forecasts into actionable strategies, we will employ advanced operations research methodologies for prescriptive analysis. This will allow us to make informed decisions regarding the dispatching, scheduling, and routing of EMS vehicles and personnel. Our approach is designed to ensure that the right resources—with appropriate equipment and trained teams—are dispatched in a timely manner, thereby reducing response times and potentially saving lives. The project will be conducted in close collaboration with the Ningbo 120 emergency centre, drawing upon their operational insights and data to inform our models. Additionally, the initiative is supported by the Nottingham China Health Institute, which will provide both expertise and resources to aid in the research and implementation of our findings.

#### 1\. _Surgery (Operating room) scheduling. Collaborated with **Ningbo First Hospital**._

Surgical operations are a crucial component of healthcare services, necessitating significant investment in costly equipment and human resources. The efficiency of surgical resource utilization is a cornerstone for cost reduction, work efficiency enhancement, and patient satisfaction. Presently, operating room scheduling is predominantly manual, leading to inflexibility, resource allocation disparities, and inefficiencies that increase patient wait times. The challenge of creating an effective operating room schedule is compounded by unpredictable emergency surgery arrivals, variable surgery durations, constraints related to specialized equipment, and the necessity for interdepartmental and staff coordination. This research project aims to address these challenges by developing sophisticated scheduling strategies that can handle the inherent complexities and unpredictabilities of the healthcare environment, improve resource use, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of care.
