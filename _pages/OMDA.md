The Operations Management and Data Analytics (OMDA) Lab aims to **solve practical, operational-level problems** commonly faced by mid-level managers across various industries.
Operations Management (OM) is the science of making better managerial decisions by the application of analytical methods.
Data Analytics (DA) is a field that revolves around the process of examining data sets to draw insights about the information they contain.
