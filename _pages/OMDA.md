The Management Science and Data Analytics (MSDA) Lab aims to **solve practical, operational-level problems** commonly faced by mid-level managers across various industries.
Management Science (MS) is the science of making the best decisions through the application of advanced mathematical methods. It focuses on the application of analytical methods to help make better managerial decisions and is a subject related to problem-solving and decision-making.
Data Analytics is a field that revolves around the process of examining data sets to draw conclusions about the information they contain. By harnessing the power of big data and using statistical and machine learning techniques, it uncovers patterns, correlations, and insights that can drive effective business decisions.
