## [SMART MANUFACTURING LAB](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=743745&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=ac9f5524d19961b37acea6e07b53901a)


As a teaching assitant, I mentored one group, with the aim at exploiting the tools and methods learned to analyze, formalize and provide a solution to the typical machine scheduling problems in the real manufacturing plants. The projects are collaborated with industries. 

The following activities are carried out:
* Machine scheduling knowledge: seminars/lectures to deepen all the technological and management aspects connected to the problem under study, i.e. parallel machine scheduling, resource constrained project scheduling.
* Data collection and processing: basic data collection and processing skills in real industrial contexts will be provided and used to design and/or validate the solutions provided.
* Modelling skills, especially the mixed interger programming(MIP) formulation skills and mathematical solver useage.
* Data analysis and visualization skills are delivered.
