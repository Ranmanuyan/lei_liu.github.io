TA, Management Engineering Master Course, Politecnico di Milano, 2021


As a teaching assitant, I mentored one group, with the aim at exploiting the tools and methods learned to analyze, formalize and provide a solution to the typical machine scheduling problems. This project is collaborated with an Italian automotive supplier company. The following activities are carried out:
* Machine scheduling knowledge: seminars/lectures to deepen all the technological and management aspects connected to the problem under study, i.e. parallel machine scheduling, resource constrained project scheduling.
* Data collection and processing: basic data collection and processing skills in real industrial contexts will be provided and used to design and/or validate the solutions provided.
* Modelling skills, especially the mixed interger programming(MIP) formulation skills and mathematical solver useage.
* Data analysis and visualization skills are delivered.
