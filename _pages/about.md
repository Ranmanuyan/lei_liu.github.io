I will join [Nottingham University Business School China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/business/home.aspx) as an Assistant Professor of Operations Management in Fall 2023. 


I got my Ph.D. in 2023, from Mechanical Engineering department of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en) where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Marcello Urgo](http://www.marcellourgo.com/), and funded by the European [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://www.digiman4-0.mek.dtu.dk/About-us/Who-are-we/ESRs). Previously, I received my master degree in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. [Canrong Zhang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/zcr_en/main.htm), and bachelor degree in Information Management from NorthEast Forestry University in 2013.

My research of interest lies on stochastic decision-making with risk measures and Markov network analysis, applications on machine scheduling and project management problems.
