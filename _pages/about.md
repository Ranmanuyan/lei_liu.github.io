I am currently an Assistant Professor of Management Science and Analytics in [Nottingham University Business School China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/business/home.aspx). 
I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en) and have been awarded the [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://www.digiman4-0.mek.dtu.dk/About-us/Who-are-we/ESRs) by the European Union. I received my master degree in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University and bachelor degree in Information Management from NorthEast Forestry University.

Currently, my research aims to develop practical solutions for real-world healthcare problems by applying methodologies from optimization, stochastic modeling, and statistics. See [Lab page](/CCO/) for details.
