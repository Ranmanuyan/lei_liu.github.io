I am currently an Assistant Professor of Operations Management in [Nottingham University Business School China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/business/home.aspx). 
I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en) and have been awarded the [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://www.digiman4-0.mek.dtu.dk/About-us/Who-are-we/ESRs) by the European Union. I received my master degree in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University and bachelor degree in Information Management from NorthEast Forestry University.

Currently, my research is centered on healthcare operations management, employing operations research and data analytics techniques. See [Lab page](/HOME/) for details.
