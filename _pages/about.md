I am currently an early stage researcher holding European [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://www.digiman4-0.mek.dtu.dk/About-us/Who-are-we/ESRs) and a third-year PhD candidate at Mechanical Engineering department of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Marcello Urgo](http://www.marcellourgo.com/), and expect to graduate in Spring 2023.

Previously, I received my master degree in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. [Canrong Zhang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/zcr_en/main.htm), and bachelor degree in Information Management from NorthEast Forestry University in 2013.

My research of interest lies on stochastic decision-making with risk measures and Markov network analysis, applications on machine scheduling and project management problems.
