I am an operations researcher, applied mathematician, optimization engineer, and coder. Practical problems have always appealed to me. Working with industry partners and tackling problems that require innovation is a very beneficial way to have an impact in the research area. It was fantastic to feel that our approaches were helping; there were societal benefits and numerous mathematical challenges, which ultimately contributed to the broader body of knowledge.

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Operations Management in [Nottingham University Business School China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/business/home.aspx). 
I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en) and have been awarded the [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://www.digiman4-0.mek.dtu.dk/About-us/Who-are-we/ESRs) by the European Union. I received my master degree in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University and bachelor degree in Information Management from NorthEast Forestry University.

Currently, my research is centered on healthcare operations management, employing operations research and data analytics techniques. See [Lab page](/HOME/) for details.
