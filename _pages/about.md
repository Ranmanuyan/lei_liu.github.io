I am currently a third-year PhD candidate and a [Marie Curie Fellow](http://www.digiman4-0.mek.dtu.dk/about-us) at Mechanical Engineering department of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Marcello Urgo](https://www.mecc.polimi.it/us/research/faculty/faculty/dr-marcello-urgo/). I expect to graduate in Spring 2023.

I received my master degree in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. [Canrong Zhang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/zcr_en/main.htm), and my bachelor degree in Information Management from NorthEast Forestry University in 2013.

My research of interest lies on stochastic decision-making with risk measures and Markovian network analysis, applications on machine scheduling and project management problems.
